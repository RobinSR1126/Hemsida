            <h2>The Hunting Rifle</h2>
            <p>The weapon is especially useful against armored foes like ballistic vest-wearing soldiers and fungus-plated Bloaters because of its armor piercing abilities. When fully upgraded, this weapon will always kill with 1 shot (human enemies) to the body, even on armored enemies, and 1 headshot on Clickers. If it is not upgraded, this weapon will not immediately kill an armored human.</p>
            <p>While the Hunting Rifle can inflict great damage with a single shot, the reload time is slow; aiming at the body is usually not a good strategy, unless you shoot at the enemy at close range and drain the rest of the foe's health with punches or melee weapons. The Hunting Rifle is perhaps best paired with the Revolver, as one body shot from the Hunting Rifle followed by a shot from the revolver always downs unarmored targets.</p>

            <p>Hawk-eyed 2 or 3 can be helpful for a sniper, as marking enemies causes their silhouettes to glow red from behind walls, and aiding in shooting targets through thin cover. This also allows leading headshots from out of cover to be more manageable. Sharpshooter and its variants can be helpful, as the reduced damage wobble can prove crucial for a weapon demanding such precision. </p>

            <h3>The Shotgun</h3>
            <p>The Shotgun is first given to Joel by Bill during the chapter "Bill's Town", during the quest to find the crashed military truck at the high school. After reaching Bill's cellar, Bill gives Joel a shotgun and takes one as well, and uses it as his primary weapon for the rest of the chapter.</p>
            <p>The shotgun is capable of achieving headshots, resulting in extra parts being rewarded for them. However, there is no additional damage given for headshots, which makes aiming for the head unnecessary in most scenarios. </p>

            <p>One major downside of the shotgun when compared to its other close range options is cost; It is one of the most expensive weapons in the game. Costing four loadout points and 400 parts, it is a significant investment to equip one. Ammunition for it is also expensive as the initial price for two rounds is 480 parts. Aside from its cost, it also has relatively limited ranged capabilities, thus relegating its use to close quarters combat.</p>
            <p>But however the shotgun has the most damage upclose meaning is the impeccable killing machine against infected like the Clicker and the bloater</p>
