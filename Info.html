            <h2> Joel Miller</h2>
            <p>Joel Miller is the playable protagonist of The Last of Us, and a supporting character in The Last of Us: Left Behind and The Last of Us Part II, in which he is briefly playable. Joel was a survivor in post-apocalyptic America that has been ravaged by the cordyceps brain infection, which has decimated 60% of mankind globally.</p>

            <p>After losing his only daughter Sarah in the early stages of the outbreak,Joel became a ruthless and cynical smuggler eventually tasked with smuggling and protecting Ellie, a young girl who was the key to mankind's survival.Joel eventually formed a strong bond with her. </p>
            <p>Joel worked in construction as a carpenter, alongside Tommy. He owned a pistol, as well as a pick-up truck outside his house. <p>Building plans laid on his bedside table along with several copies of a book called Construction Regionalism on top of his bookshelf.</p>
                <p> He possessed ambitions of starting his own business, with a copy of Everything You Need to Know About Creating a Startup also on a table next to his bed. His job kept him fit, and he owned a treadmill in his bedroom. He mentioned in a phone call that he was struggling to keep his job with a contractor.</p>

                <p>Despite his long, hard-working hours, he still managed to spend quality time with Sarah, as seen in photographs displayed throughout their home showing the two on a cruise, at a carnival with Tommy, and one of Sarah's soccer matches. Additionally, the two often went on several hikes together.Sarah also made him take her to every museum in Texas.

                    In the hours leading up to the outbreak, Sarah gave him a new watch as a birthday gift to replace the one he had broken months before.This became a cherished memento he manages to keep in the turbulent years ahead </p>


                <h3>Ellie Williams</h3>
                <p>Around the time Marlene and Ellie planned to leave Boston for Salt Lake City. Marlene is injured during her search for the smuggler Robert, a man she had initially hired to escort Ellie out of Boston. Desperate to get her out of the city, Marlene hires two well known, feared, and experienced smugglers, Joel and Tess, to escort Ellie out of the city before the military wipes out the Fireflies. She arranges for a small team of Fireflies to meet the three at the Capitol building. Although Ellie insists she's staying with Marlene, the Firefly refuses, hoping that Joel will live up to Tommy's recommendation.

                    <p>While Tess goes with Marlene to verify the weapons Marlene has promised the pair, Ellie is taken by Joel to an apartment close to the outer wall. While making their way there, Joel asks where her parents are and why Marlene is so fixated on her, among other things. Ellie avoids answering why she is being smuggled but does inform Joel that her parents died and that she's 14. Upon meeting Joel, Ellie originally has a rocky relationship with him. Ellie struggled to make him trust her, the man initially believing that she was lying about being immune to the infection</p>.<p> She was unable to talk about anything personal with him, the man shutting her out when she attempted to make general conversation or brought up matters like Tess and Sam's deaths. However, as time passed, Ellie establishes not only a daughter-father relationship, but a bond of protection with Joel.</p>

                    <p>Ellie struggled to make Joel trust her initially. The man kept himself distant from her, refusing to disclose personal information about himself.[16][19] Even after Tess' death, Joel kept conversation focussed only around transporting Ellie to the Fireflies despite her efforts to discuss more personal topics, notably her own history and Joel's own interests.</p>


                    <p>Ellie with Joel on Callus.</p>

                    <p>Ellie also struggled to earn his trust to use a gun. At first, Joel refused her the right to a firearm, judging her a child incapable of using one. However, after she used a handgun to save his life from a Hunter, Joel granted her a rifle to use. Ellie also managed to convince him to then permanently gift her a pistol. Ellie even proved herself enough that Joel spent less time in combat with enemies focussing on protection and more so having her assist him in defeating them. Her prime example of this prowess was when the protection roles were reversed with Ellie protecting and defending Joel at the University from cannibals. Through this experience, Ellie earned Joel's absolute trust, the man finally acknowledging her as an equal.</p>

                    <p> Eliie is a playable character both in The last of us part 1 and part 2. In the first game you get to play as her in the next to last chapter. But in the second game you only play as Eliie only because Joel dies an hour in to the game due to horible writing by neil fuckman</p>
