            <p>The infected are a huge part och The last of us, they are your enemy as you progress throughout the game. One type of Zombie you will come across are the stalkers. The Stalker are the second stage of the infection. They have the vision of the runners and the felocity of Clickers. </p>
            <p>The most notable physical traits that define the Stalkers are the distinct croaking noises they make, the beginning of fungal growths on the head and face with only one eye left, the development of pseudo-echolocation, and their discretion upon spotting a victim at a distance. They will strafe and take cover, eventually closing in on their target, hence the name "Stalker"</p>.<p> Up close, Stalkers are very aggressive and will charge directly at the victim. Stage 2 may take place anywhere between a week to a month after the start of the infection (Stage 1) and last up to a year. They are typically found in abandoned, poorly lit buildings and parking lots, though they also appear in the sewers and subway areas.</p>
            <p>Some Stalkers have a bioluminescent vein in the face which makes them easier to see in the dark. They are fast and deadly in combat, especially when confronted in numbers.</p>
            <p>Because of this, it is best for players to keep their distance when trying to confront a group of Stalkers. The player may lure nearby Stalkers and then use high powered guns like the Shotgun or Flamethrower as they approach Joel.</p>

            <p>Clickers are the third stage of the Infected in The Last of Us, The Last of Us Part II, and Left Behind. They take roughly a year to reach this stage of infection after roughly one year of exposure to the Cordyceps Brain Infection.[1] They have had prolonged exposure to the fungus, and now possess strength that significantly surpasses the average human. Clickers appear less human than Runners and Stalkers, with faces that are completely skewed and scarred by fungus developed from their infected brains. The fungal plates have adapted to keep the host/pathogen alive and able to spread, as a direct shot to the face with a powerful weapon such as a revolver will more often than not just break off a chunk of the mold, leaving the Clicker's brain unharmed but exposing the victim's face and rendering them able to see once again (until the fungus regrows). This makes them deadlier, but at the price of being completely blind due to fungal infection taking over their face.</p>

            <p>However, Clickers are able to maneuver through areas by utilizing echolocation, which produces noticeable clicking/screeching noises to locate sources of sound, hence their name</p>.<p> Like Runners, Clickers can sometimes be found in a passive state. Clickers are dangerous and much more aggressive than Runners, and like Stalkers, they no longer resist the fungus because their humanity has been completely eliminated</p>. They seem to have enhanced strength, as they can overwhelm and kill Joel if grappled and always succeed if attacking other humans, like the group at the mountain plaza. <p>Clickers also possess what seems like very high intelligence, never leaving an area when they have heard prey run by them, and will constantly check every available nook and cranny to locate the source of the sound with little regard to giving up on the task at hand. </p>

            <p>When provoked, a Clicker will immediately enter into a "berserk mode," aggressively flailing its arms and 'roaring'. At this point, if a survivor has been "spotted" by a Clicker, the Clicker will attack head-on and will not flinch when shot, unless the player is using high-powered rounds. </p>
            <p>Punching a Clicker with bare hands is ineffective; after three punches, the player will not have time to back away and will be instantly grappled by the Clicker. This is especially if the Clicker is in berserk mode, where it overrides the player's punch. It is recommended that players use a melee weapon if they choose this form of attack. If not, the ideal weapons to use are the shotgun, El Diablo and the flamethrower because they, when used effectively, guarantee a kill.</p>
